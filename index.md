## Integration is essential
As many organizations are discovering, digital transformation fuels innovation and boosts speed to market. In the process, data often gets trapped in silos, impeding the ability of users, both inside and outside the business, to access the information they need.
With IBM integration solutions, you can connect applications and systems to unlock critical data quickly and securely.
The following are a list of varies areas depending on your integration needs. 

## What is a Proof of Technology?
Proof of Technology sessions are complimentary classes to build
understanding of IBM technology and software with practical
presentations and hands-on lab exercises. 

We will cover all the various components that are part of Integration. We will also discuss how these components can be used in combination. The following are the varies areas depending on your interest.

*  **IBM App Connect**
*  **IBM API Connect**
*  **IBM DataPower Gateway**
*  **IBM Event Streams**
*  **IBM MQ Advanced**
*  **IBM Aspera High Speed Transfer Server**

| <a href="https://ibm-cloudintegration.github.io/CP4I-PoT-Public/" target="_blank">IBM Cloud Pak for Integration</a>        | IBM Cloud Pak for Integration is the industry’s most complete, container-based, cloud-portable integration platform that brings together API management, application integration, messaging, events — all running consistently across any hybrid or multi-cloud environment.<br>In this workshop we will be running labs using RedHat OpenShift containers. 
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|   
|<a href="https://pages.github.ibm.com/americas-integration/AppConnect-CoE/" target="_blank">IBM App Connect</a>        | App Connect is the application and data integration engine inside IBM Cloud Pak for Integration and also standalone on VMs. It is designed for both business users (low-code) and professional developers (code-first).<br>In this workshop we will be running App Connect labs standalone in VMs.  <br><br>**This lab is still in private repo** 
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|     
| [IBM MQ](MQ/index.md)          | The “nervous system” for mission-critical applications: it moves data reliably between applications when failure is not an option.<br> If your business literally cannot afford to lose or duplicate a message → MQ is still unmatched.<br>MQ is now well into its fourth decade and remains the de-facto standard for enterprises where “it has to just work, forever”.<br><br>In this workshop we will be running MQ labs standalone in VMs.
